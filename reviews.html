                        Korean Tofu House is an authentic Korean Restaurant located in the University of Washington area "University
                        District".
                        This restaurant has great portions for the price, with probably the best Korean food I've had in the past several
                        years!

                        Snowy Village is a Korean-style shaved ice dessert shop located in the University of Washington area "University
                        District".
                        This cafe has a variety of shaved ice options! A unique different here is that the shaved ice is not actually from ice, 
                        but from frozen milk, so every spoon is full of savory taste!

                        Pelicana is a Korean Fried Chicken chain that is popular on the West Coast. This chain was located in
                        Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA. While the chicken and the atmosphere of the restaurant was appealing, there was
                        not much flavor or meat on the chicken (mostly bone) :( and was quite pricey.

                        Juju Durham is an Asian fusion restaurant located in Durham, NC by the Duke University campus. The setting is very
                        fancy with the food presentation being immaculate! The dishes (the one pictured here is the steak stir fry) was full of 
                        flavor and spices. The rice that was accompanied also had some great furikake for seasoning.
