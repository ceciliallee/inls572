        <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this webpage is show all the different types of food that I was able to explore in Seattle, WA over Summer 2022, and also other food spots in the Research Triangle Park area from my time in North Carolina. I would be sharing pictures of the food, the location of the food spot, the types of food the place offers, and a general description and opinion of the spot so that the readers can decide if they are also willing to try. 
            <br> The intended audience is for other individuals who are foodies and want to explore new kinds of spots for food and eats in this area or in Seattle, or just browse for entertainment purposes.</p>
